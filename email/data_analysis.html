  <p>Hi John Doe, I hope you had a pleasant weekend.</p>

  <p>I did my analysis and this is what the data tells us:
     
       send mobile alerts at these hours: 13, 16
    
       and increase marketing on: Saturday.
  </p>
  <p>Please reach out to me if you need any additional information. 
     I'll be happy to send my analysis to the marketing department.
  </p>
  <p>
     Have a good rest of your day!
     Jane Doe
